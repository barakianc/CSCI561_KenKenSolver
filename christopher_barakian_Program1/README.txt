CS561 Programing 1

The two folders christopher_barakian_programming1 and christopher_barakian_programming1_ExtraCredit
contains my two implementations of the KenKen puzzle solver.  The first is the basic and the second
is the extra credit one with the heuristic implemented.  Both programs on completion output to the terminal 
the totaltime it took to complete in seconds so you can compare the speed of both programs.  The 
christopher_barakian_programming1questions.doc file contains my answers to the written questions for the 
programing assignment.  Both programs were implemented in c++ on visula studio 2010.  note running in release
mode greatly increase the speed in comparison to running in debug mode in visula studio
